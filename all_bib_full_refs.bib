abstract = {Studies suggest that self-harm users found it easier to discuss self-harm-related thoughts and behaviors using social media than in the physical world. Given the enormous and increasing volume of social media data, on-line self-harm content is likely to be buried rapidly by other normal content. To enable voices of self-harm users to be heard, it is important to distinguish self-harm content from other types of content. In this paper, we aim to understand self-harm content and provide automatic approaches to its detection. We first perform a comprehensive analysis on self-harm social media using different input cues. Our analysis, the first of its kind in large scale, reveals a number of important findings. Then we propose frameworks that incorporate the findings to discover self-harm content under both supervised and unsupervised settings. Our experimental results on a large social media dataset from Flickr demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks and the importance of our findings in discovering self-harm content.},

abstract = {Eating disorders are complex mental disorders and responsible for the highest mortality rate among mental illnesses. Recent studies reveal that user-generated content on social media provides useful information in understanding these disorders. Most previous studies focus on studying communities of people who discuss eating disorders on social media, while few studies have explored community structures and interactions among individuals who suffer from this disease over social media. In this paper, we first develop a snowball sampling method to automatically gather individuals who self-identify as eating disordered in their profile descriptions, as well as their social network connections with one another on Twitter. Then, we verify the effectiveness of our sampling method by: 1. quantifying differences between the sampled eating disordered users and two sets of reference data collected for non-disordered users in social status, behavioral patterns and psychometric properties; 2. building predictive models to classify eating disordered and non-disordered users. Finally, leveraging the data of social connections between eating disordered individuals on Twitter, we present the first homophily study among eating-disorder communities on social media. Our findings shed new light on how an eating-disorder community develops on social media.},

Therefore, this qualitative case study explored (1) how signs and symptoms of suicide ideation and severe depression can present within the context of social media and (2) how on-line signs and symptoms can be used to create screening tools for the general public. Content analysis of media reports, newspapers, and social media sites revealed several themes such as (1) loneliness, depression and hopelessness were key symptoms, (2) personality characteristics and frequency of social media use acted as mediators to identifying escalation of mental health distress, and (3) engaging in social media may provide both support and further pain for a person experiencing depression. These insights are used to make recommendations for future studies and the development of online screening tools.",

Making effective detection systems for abusive content relies on having the right training datasets, reflecting a widely accepted mantra in computer science: Garbage In, Garbage Out. However, creating training datasets which are large, varied, theoretically-informed and that minimize biases is difficult, laborious and requires deep expertise. This paper systematically reviews 63 publicly available training datasets which have been created to train abusive language classifiers. It also reports on creation of a dedicated website for cataloguing abusive language data hatespeechdata.com. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of open science in this field, and argue that although more dataset sharing would bring many benefits it also poses social and ethical risks which need careful consideration. Finally, we provide evidence-based recommendations for practitioners creating new abusive content training datasets.},

This exchange is not free from offensive, trolling or malicious contents targeting users or communities. One way of trolling is by making memes, which in most cases combines an image with a concept or catchphrase. The challenge of dealing with memes is that they are region-specific and their meaning is often obscured in humour or sarcasm. To facilitate the computational modelling of trolling in the memes for Indian languages, we created a meme dataset for Tamil (TamilMemes). We annotated and released the dataset containing suspected trolls and not-troll memes. In this paper, we use the a image classification to address the difficulties involved in the classification of troll memes with the existing methods. We found that the identification of a troll meme with such an image classifier is not feasible which has been corroborated with precision, recall and F1-score.",

    abstract = "Internet memes have become powerful means to transmit political, psychological, and socio-cultural ideas. Although memes are typically humorous, recent days have witnessed an escalation of harmful memes used for trolling, cyberbullying, and abuse. Detecting such memes is challenging as they can be highly satirical and cryptic. Moreover, while previous work has focused on specific aspects of memes such as hate speech and propaganda, there has been little work on harm in general. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we focus on two tasks: (i)detecting harmful memes, and (ii) identifying the social entities they target. We further extend the recently released HarMeme dataset, which covered COVID-19, with additional memes and a new topic: US politics. To solve these tasks, we propose MOMENTA (MultimOdal framework for detecting harmful MemEs aNd Their tArgets), a novel multimodal deep neural network that uses global and local perspectives to detect harmful memes. MOMENTA systematically analyzes the local and the global perspective of the input meme (in both modalities) and relates it to the background context. MOMENTA is interpretable and generalizable, and our experiments show that it outperforms several strong rivaling approaches.",

However, despite these advances, there are still desirable functionalities missing from the fact-checking pipeline. In this survey, we focus on the explanation functionality {--} that is fact-checking systems providing reasons for their predictions. We summarize existing methods for explaining the predictions of fact-checking systems and we explore trends in this topic. Further, we consider what makes for good explanations in this specific domain through a comparative analysis of existing fact-checking explanations against some desirable properties. Finally, we propose further research directions for generating fact-checking explanations, and describe how these may lead to improvements in the research area.",

    abstract = "Propaganda can be defined as a form of communication that aims to influence the opinions or the actions of people towards a specific goal; this is achieved by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Propaganda, in the form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th century. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media that propaganda has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming major societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in social media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in mind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of propaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus of 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can appear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows that understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these techniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several state-of-the-art multimodal models.",

We first explore the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) as a discriminative model and then extend it to a hierarchical architecture to utilize the additional hate category information for more accurate prediction. Experimentally, we show that incorporating the hate category information for training can significantly improve the classification performance and our proposed model outperforms commonly-used discriminative models.",

This is further exacerbated at the time of a pandemic. To tackle this, we curate and release a manually annotated dataset of 10,700 social media posts and articles of real and fake news on COVID-19. We perform a binary classification task (real vs fake) and benchmark the annotated dataset with four machine learning baselines - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We obtain the best performance of 93.32{\%} F1-score with SVM on the test set. The data and code is available at: https://github.com/parthpatwa/covid19-fake-news-dectection.",

Research on fact checking has benefited from large-scale datasets such as FEVER and SNLI. However, such datasets suffer from limited applicability due to the synthetic nature of claims and/or evidence written by annotators that differ from real claims and evidence on the internet. To this end, we present WikiFactCheck-English, a dataset of 124k+ triples consisting of a claim, context and an evidence document extracted from English Wikipedia articles and citations, as well as 34k+ manually written claims that are refuted by the evidence documents. This is the largest fact checking dataset consisting of real claims and evidence to date; it will allow the development of fact checking systems that can better process claims and evidence in the real world. We also show that for the NLI subtask, a logistic regression system trained using existing and novel features achieves peak accuracy of 68{\%}, providing a competitive baseline for future work. Also, a decomposable attention model trained on SNLI significantly underperforms the models trained on this dataset, suggesting that models trained on manually generated data may not be sufficiently generalizable or suitable for fact checking real-world claims.",

This paper provides the first study of how these explanations can be generated automatically based on available claim context, and how this task can be modelled jointly with veracity prediction. Our results indicate that optimising both objectives at the same time, rather than training them separately, improves the performance of a fact checking system. The results of a manual evaluation further suggest that the informativeness, coverage and overall quality of the generated explanations are also improved in the multi-task model.",

But how they source and verify UGC has not yet been systematically analyzed. This study analyzes sourcing and verification practices on Twitter during the Brussels attacks in March 2016. Based on quantitative content analysis, we identified (1) the journalists and news organizations sourcing during the attacks, (2) classified different forms of sourcing and verification requests, and (3) analyzed the sourced UGC. Results show that sourcing on Twitter has become a global phenomenon. During the first hours of the attack, journalists rely on UGC. Their sourcing and verification practices vary widely and often lack basic verification procedures, which leads to a discussion about the ethical implications of sourcing practices. }

We summarize how people respond to corrections of misinformation, and what kinds of corrections are most effective. We argue that to be effective, scientific research into misinformation must be considered within a larger political, technological, and societal context. The post-truth world emerged as a result of societal mega-trends such as a decline in social capital, growing economic inequality, increased polarization, declining trust in science, and an increasingly fractionated media landscape. We suggest that responses to this malaise must involve technological solutions incorporating psychological principles, an interdisciplinary approach that we describe as “technocognition.” We outline a number of recommendations to counter misinformation in a post-truth world.}

However, as much as sharing new ideas or asking thoughtful questions contributes learning, verbally abusive behaviors, such as expressing negative emotions in online discussions, could have disproportionate detrimental effects. To provide means for mitigating the potential negative effects on course participation and learning, we developed an automated classifier for identifying communication that show linguistic patterns associated with hostility in online forums. In so doing, we employ several well-established automated text analysis tools and build on the common practices for handling highly imbalanced datasets and reducing the sensitivity to overfitting. Although still in its infancy, our approach shows promising results (ROC AUC .73) towards establishing a robust detector of abusive behaviors. We further provide an overview of the classification (linguistic and contextual) features most indicative of online aggression.",

    abstract = "The disciplines of Gender Studies and Data Science are incompatible. This is conventional wisdom, supported by how many computational studies simplify gender into an immutable binary categorization that appears crude to the critical social researcher. I argue that the characterization of gender norms is context specific and may prove valuable in constructing useful models. I show how gender can be framed in computational studies as a stylized repetition of acts mediated by a social structure, and not a possessed biological category. By conducting a review of existing work, I show how gender should be explored in multiplicity in computational research through clustering techniques, and layout how this is being achieved in a study in progress on gender hostility on Stack Overflow.",

 abstract = {Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up with the enormous volume of information that is now generated online. Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.},

@article{Baxter1997,
 abstract = {A Bayesian model of learning to learn by sampling from multiple tasks is presented. The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution. It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation (LDR) for an environment of related tasks.},

@article{CHAKRABORTY2020106754,
 abstract = {COVID-19 originally known as Corona VIrus Disease of 2019, has been declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. Unprecedented pressures have mounted on each country to make compelling requisites for controlling the population by assessing the cases and properly utilizing available resources. The rapid number of exponential cases globally has become the apprehension of panic, fear and anxiety among people. The mental and physical health of the global population is found to be directly proportional to this pandemic disease. The current situation has reported more than twenty four million people being tested positive worldwide as of 27th August, 2020. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to implement different measures to safeguard the countries by demystifying the pertinent facts and information. This paper aims to bring out the fact that tweets containing all handles related to COVID-19 and WHO have been unsuccessful in guiding people around this pandemic outbreak appositely. This study analyzes two types of tweets gathered during the pandemic times. In one case, around twenty three thousand most re-tweeted tweets within the time span from 1st Jan 2019 to 23rd March 2020 have been analyzed and observation says that the maximum number of the tweets portrays neutral or negative sentiments. On the other hand, a dataset containing 226,668 tweets collected within the time span between December 2019 and May 2020 have been analyzed which contrastingly show that there were a maximum number of positive and neutral tweets tweeted by netizens. The research demonstrates that though people have tweeted mostly positive regarding COVID-19, yet netizens were busy engrossed in re-tweeting the negative tweets and that no useful words could be found in WordCloud or computations using word frequency in tweets. The claims have been validated through a proposed model using deep learning classifiers with admissible accuracy up to 81%. Apart from these the authors have proposed the implementation of a Gaussian membership function based fuzzy rule base to correctly identify sentiments from tweets. The accuracy for the said model yields up to a permissible rate of 79%.},

CLEF 2020 CheckThat! shared task, where we determined the check-worthiness of 
tweets about COVID-19 to prioritise tweets for fact-checking. We utilised a BERT 
language model with binary classification and sigmoid for ranking. In 
particular, we used the uncased COVID-Twitter-BERT architecture that had been 
pre-trained on COVID-19 Twitter stream data using two different language 
modelling tasks: whole word-masked modelling and next sentence prediction. The 
model was trained by jointly optimising a binary cross-entropy loss. We 
performed traditional Twitter data preprocessing in order to improve system 
performance: (1) All Twitter account handles, digits, hashtags and hyperlinks 
were removed; (2) A vector look-up was then used for each token from CO-BERT 
model; (3) Each token was thereafter mapped to a unique integer in the corpus’ 
vocabulary, done using two tokenisers which performed differently in different 
cases; (4) Padding was used to equalise the lengths of the input sequences in a 
batch, i.e. we increase the length of some sequences by adding tokens. We 
attempted to reduce the padding by letting our model decide the padding length 
based on the given batch and its longest sequence, reducing any unnecessary 
overhead carried by the model. We ranked fourth in the task.},

We use Part-of-speech (POS) tags, named entities, and dependency relations as syntactic features and a combination of hidden layers in BERT to compute tweet embedding, and concatenate them to get a large feature embedding. We then reduce the feature size by applying PCA and train an SVM classifier for binary classification of tweets. We conduct a detailed analysis of syntactic feature combinations, word2vec embeddings and BERT hidden layer combinations to find the best performing model. For the second problem, we explore the pre-trained embeddings from a Siamese network transformer model (sentence transformers) specifically trained for semantic textual similarity and perform KD-search to retrieve claims. We further fine-tune these models using triplets with a triplet loss and conduct detailed experiments with different backbone networks.},

Therefore, automated systems that can prioritize claims based on their check-worthiness have a big role to prevent spreading of misinformation. In this paper, we propose three different models for CLEF Check That! Lab. In all our models, we use logistic regression. The first one uses BERT and word embeddings together. The second model is a hybrid combination of BERT and the first model such that we use only fine-tuned BERT for the first 15 claims. For the others, we use the first model. The last model is a modification of the first model with additional features which are pos tags, domain-specific controversial topics and a handcrafted word list. For the Arabic task, we use AraBert as our Bert model.  We use the first and second models for Task 1 Arabic and all models for Task 1 English and Task 5.
In the official evaluation of primary submissions, our primary models a) ranked 3rd in Task 1 Arabic based on P@30 and shared the 1st rank with another group on P@5,  b) ranked 4th in Task 1 English based on MAP and shared the 1st rank with 5 other groups on RR, P@1, P@3 and P@5, and c) ranked 3rd in Task 5 based on MAP.},

of Information Extraction and Deep Learning strategies to associate a tweet 
with the corresponding claim. The system has been built starting from a 
pre-trained Sentence-BERT model on which two cascade fine-tuning steps have been 
applied. The first step is a sentence similarity task aimed at predicting the 
cosine similarity between a tweet and a claim. Sentence-BERT was used to fine 
tune the model on this task by building a training set in which positive 
examples, consisting of gold tweet-claim pairs, were associated with a maximum 
cosine similarity. Negative examples were instead randomly selected from a list 
of candidate pairs with a non empty overlap in terms of metadata (named entities 
and keywords). Such examples were associated with the original cosine similarity 
between the tweet and claim, lowered by applying a penalty function. The second 
step consists in a binary classification task aimed at deciding whether a 
tweet-claim pair is a correct match or not. The model fine-tuned in the first 
step was enriched with a classifier head on top. Positive and negative examples 
were selected as above to construct the training set. The final ranking produced 
by the system is the predicted probability of the pair labelled as correct. 
Overall, the system reached a 0.91 MAP@5 on the test set.},

 abstract = {The Accenture team will describe experiments in using transformer fine-tuning to automatically fact-check tweets in English and Arabic.
We fine-tuned the English training data with the RoBERTa base model which was created and open-sourced by Liu et al \cite{roberta}. The base-roberta model was pretrained on 160GB of text extracted from BookCorpus, English Wikipedia, CC-News, OpenWebText, and Stories. To help prevent overfitting, we added an extra mean pooling and dropout layer to the model.
We fine-tuned the Arabic training data with 3 different pre-trained Arabic BERT models- two of which were not trained on stemmed tokens. We used two BERT bases which were pretrained and made open source by Wissam Antoun, Fady Baly, and Hazem Hajj at the American University of Beiruit \cite{aubmindlabs}. The Aubmindlabs Arabert was pretrained on Arabic Articles manually scraped by researchers along with two open source corpora: (1) the 1.5 billion word Arabic Corpus, which contains more than 5 million news articles from ten major news sources. and (2) OSIAN: the Open Source International Arabic News Corpus, which includes more than 3.5 million articles from 31  news sources \cite{aubmindlabs}
In order to improve label balance in the Arabic corpus, and to improve lexical diversity, we used machine translation as an external data source to upsample the positive class of the Arabic training data.  We took the Arabic text, and used Amazon Translate to translate this into English and then back to Arabic.  These translated tweets served as additional training data.
While metadata was provided for the Arabic and English tweets, this approach utilized only the language content.},

@article{Friedman:01,
 abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

@article{info:doi/10.2196/19273,
 abstract = {Background: At the time of this writing, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources, and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much of the conversation about these phenomena now occurs online on social media platforms like Twitter. Objective: In this paper, we describe a multilingual COVID-19 Twitter data set that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19-TweetIDs GitHub repository. Methods: We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter's streaming application programming interface (API) and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were trending at the time data collection began. We used Twitter's search API to query for past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January 21, 2020. Results: Since the inception of our collection, we have actively maintained and updated our GitHub repository on a weekly basis. We have published over 123 million tweets, with over 60{\%} of the tweets in English. This paper also presents basic statistics that show that Twitter activity responds and reacts to COVID-19-related events. Conclusions: It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and implications. This data set could also help track COVID-19-related misinformation and unverified rumors or enable the understanding of fear and panic---and undoubtedly more. },

@article{KALIYAR202032,
 abstract = {With the increasing popularity of social media and web-based forums, the distribution of fake news has become a major threat to various sectors and agencies. This has abated trust in the media, leaving readers in a state of perplexity. There exists an enormous assemblage of research on the theme of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for fake news detection. In the past, much of the focus has been given on classifying online reviews and freely accessible online social networking-based posts. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (FNDNet) for fake news detection. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features, our model (FNDNet) is designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification through multiple hidden layers built in the deep neural network. We create a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract several features at each layer. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with several baseline models. Benchmarked datasets were used to train and test the model, and the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of 98.36\% on the test data. Various performance evaluation parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, true negative, precision, recall, F1, and accuracy, etc. were used to validate the results. These results demonstrate significant improvements in the area of fake news detection as compared to existing state-of-the-art results and affirm the potential of our approach for classifying fake news on social media. This research will assist researchers in broadening the understanding of the applicability of CNN-based deep models for fake news detection.},

@article{SAHOO2021106983,
 abstract = {In recent years, the rise of Online Social Networks has led to proliferation of social news such as product advertisement, political news, celebrity’s information, etc. Some of the social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter affected by their user through fake news. Unfortunately, some users use unethical means to grow their links and reputation by spreading fake news in the form of texts, images, and videos. However, the recent information appearing on an online social network is doubtful, and in many cases, it misleads other users in the network. Fake news is spread intentionally to mislead readers to believe false news, which makes it difficult for detection mechanism to detect fake news on the basis of shared content. Therefore, we need to add some new information related to user’s profile, such as user’s involvement with others for finding a particular decision. The disseminated information and their diffusion process create a big problem for detecting these contents promptly and thus highlighting the need for automatic fake news detection. In this paper, we are going to introduce automatic fake news detection approach in chrome environment on which it can detect fake news on Facebook. Specifically, we use multiple features associated with Facebook account with some news content features to analyze the behavior of the account through deep learning. The experimental analysis of real-world information demonstrates that our intended fake news detection approach has achieved higher accuracy than the existing state of art techniques.},

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of fauxtography, analyzing the use of manipulated or misleading images in news discussion on online communities. First, we develop a computational pipeline geared to detect fauxtography, and identify over 61k instances of fauxtography discussed on Twitter, 4chan, and Reddit. Then, we study how posting fauxtography affects engagement of posts on social media, finding that posts containing it receive more interactions in the form of re-shares, likes, and comments. Finally, we show that fauxtography images are often turned into memes by Web communities. Our findings show that effective mitigation against disinformation need to take images into account, and highlight a number of challenges in dealing with image-based disinformation.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Wang, Yuping and Tahmasbi, Fatemeh and Blackburn, Jeremy and Bradlyn, Barry and De Cristofaro, Emiliano and Magerman, David and Zannettou, Savvas and Stringhini, Gianluca}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={776-786} }

    abstract = "Memes are the combinations of text and images that are often humorous in nature. But, that may not always be the case, and certain combinations of texts and images may depict hate, referred to as hateful memes. This work presents a multimodal pipeline that takes both visual and textual features from memes into account to (1) identify the protected category (e.g. race, sex etc.) that has been attacked; and (2) detect the type of attack (e.g. contempt, slurs etc.). Our pipeline uses state-of-the-art pre-trained visual and textual representations, followed by a simple logistic regression classifier. We employ our pipeline on the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset with additional newly created fine-grained labels for protected category and type of attack. Our best model achieves an AUROC of 0.96 for identifying the protected category, and 0.97 for detecting the type of attack. We release our code at https://github.com/harisbinzia/HatefulMemes",

    abstract = { “BBQ Becky” and “Karen” memes reference real-world incidents in which Black individuals were harassed by White women in public spaces. In what I term the BBQ Becky meme genre, Black meme creators use humor, satire, and strategic positioning to perform a set of interrelated social commentaries on the behavior of White women. By conducting a visual Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) of BBQ Becky memes, I argue that Becky and Karen memes are a cultural critique of White surveillance and White racial dominance. I find that memes in the BBQ Becky meme genre call attention to, and reject, White women’s surveillance and regulation of Black bodies in public spaces—making an important connection between racialized surveillance of the past and contemporary acts of “casual” racism. This meme genre also disrupts White supremacist logics and performative racial ignorance by framing Karens and Beckys as racist—not just disgruntled or entitled. Finally, in a subversion and reversal of power dynamics, Karen and BBQ Becky memes police White supremacy and explicitly call for consequences, providing Black communities with a form of agency. Hence, I conclude that Black memes matter in the struggle for racial equity. }

    abstract = "A meme is a form of media that spreads an idea or emotion across the internet. As posting meme has become a new form of communication of the web, due to the multimodal nature of memes, postings of hateful memes or related events like trolling, cyberbullying are increasing day by day. Hate speech, offensive content and aggression content detection have been extensively explored in a single modality such as text or image. However, combining two modalities to detect offensive content is still a developing area. Memes make it even more challenging since they express humour and sarcasm in an implicit way, because of which the meme may not be offensive if we only consider the text or the image. Therefore, it is necessary to combine both modalities to identify whether a given meme is offensive or not. Since there was no publicly available dataset for multimodal offensive meme content detection, we leveraged the memes related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election and created the MultiOFF multimodal meme dataset for offensive content detection dataset. We subsequently developed a classifier for this task using the MultiOFF dataset. We use an early fusion technique to combine the image and text modality and compare it with a text- and an image-only baseline to investigate its effectiveness. Our results show improvements in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-Score.

 abstract = {ABSTRACT: In the past decade, people associated with what is known as the alt-right have employed a strategy similar to that of progressive, antiracist satirists to advance a decidedly white supremacist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, and deadly serious agenda. As this article documents, the alt-right weaponizes irony to attract and radicalize potential supporters, challenge progressive ideologies and institutions, redpill normies, and create a toxic counterpublic. Discussing examples of satiric irony generated by the extreme right alongside those produced by the (often mainstream) left, this article pairs two satirical memes, two activists’ use of irony, two ambiguously satirical tweets, and two recent controversies pertaining to racism and satire so as to illustrate how people with very different political commitments employ a similar style with potent effects. Of particular significance are reverse racism discourses, including “white genocide,” and the increasingly complicated relationship between intentions, extremism, and satire.},

I trace a recent turn to humor, irony, and ambiguity in their online communication and the increasing adaptation of stylistic strategies and visual aesthetics of the Alt-Right inspired by online communities such as 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, and Imgur. Drawing on a visual content analysis of memes (N = 634) created and circulated by the organization, the analysis explores the place of humor, irony, and ambiguity across these cultural expressions of neo-Nazism and how ideas, symbols, and layers of meaning travel back and forth between neo-Nazi and Alt-right groups within Sweden today. }

I argue these memes celebrate White masculinity, while at the same time constructing African American athletes as individualistic, selfish, and unwilling to sacrifice their bodies for the greater good of the team. More so, I argue that these memes construct a form of racial ideology that is representative of White backlash politics. }

For example, People of Color experience racial microaggressions (i.e., subtle slights or ‘put downs’) in their face-to-face interactions (Nadal, 2011) and in online contexts (Clark et al., 2011). This study investigates whether experiencing subtle racial discrimination offline can influence perceptions of online content, specifically racial themed Internet memes. Results indicate that although both People of Color and Whites viewed racial themed memes to be more offensive than non-racial themed memes (control images), for People of Color the ratings of racial themed memes were predicted by previous discrimination; those who reported experiencing more racial microaggressions in everyday settings rated racial themed memes as more offensive. The same pattern of results did not emerge for ratings of non-racial themed memes or for White participants. These results provide initial evidence that experiencing racial microaggressions in offline interactions may lead individuals from racial minority groups to be more likely to perceive racial discrimination in online settings.}

Although contemporary emoji represent a variety of races, genders, and sexual orientations, the original emoji set came under fire for its racial homogeneity: minus two “ethnic” characters, the people emoji featured in Unicode 7.0 were represented as White. This article investigates the set of circumstances that gave rise to this state of affairs, and explores the implications for users of color whose full participation in the emoji phenomenon is constrained by their exclusion. This project reveals that the lack of racial representation within the emoji set is the result of colorblind racism as evidenced through two related factors: aversion to, and avoidance of, the politics of technical systems and a refusal to recognize that the racial homogeneity of the original emoji set was problematic in the first place. }

abstract = {Read and considered thoughtfully, Safiya Umoja Noble's Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism is devastating. It reduces to rubble the notion that technology is neutral and ideology-free. Noble's crushing the neutrality myth does several things. First, this act lays foundations for her argument: only if you recognize and understand that technology is built with, and integrates, bias, can you then be open to her primary thesis: search engines advance discriminatory and often racist content. Second, it banishes a convenient response for many self-identified meritocratic Silicon Valley "winners" and their supporters. Post-reading, some individuals may retain their beliefs in a neutral and ideology-free technology in spite of the overwhelming evidence and citations Noble brings to bear. Effective countering of Noble's claims is unlikely to occur. For professionals working in technology, information, argumentation, and/or rhetorical studies, Algorithms of Oppression is refreshing. Agonistic towards structural racism and its defenses, single-minded in its evidentiary presentation, collaborative in its acknowledgement of others' scholarship and research, Noble models many academic, critical, and social moves. Technology scholars and writers will find in Algorithms of Oppression a masterful mentor text on how to be an activist researcher scholar. Noble also makes this enjoyable reading. It is uncommon to find academic books that can simultaneously be read, used, and applied by academics and non-academics alike.},

However, it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.},

Specifically, it focuses on how the subcultural and highly reactionary milieu of 4chan’s /pol/ board does so through an anti-Semitic meme called triple parentheses. In aggregating the contents of this peculiar meme from a large dataset of /pol/ comments, the article finds that /pol/ users, or anons, tend to use the meme to formulate a nebulous out-group resonant with populist demagoguery. }

    abstract = { The Internet is a space where the harassment of women and marginalised groups online has attracted the attention of both academic and popular press. Feminist research has found that instances of online sexism and harassment are often reframed as “acceptable” by constructing them as a form of humour. Following this earlier research, this present paper explores a uniquely technologically-bound type of humour by adopting a feminist, social-constructionist approach to examine the content of popular Internet memes. Using thematic analysis on a sample of 240 image macro Internet memes (those featuring an image with a text caption overlaid), we identified two broad, overarching themes – Technological Privilege and Others. Within the analysis presented here, complex and troubling constructions of gendered identity in online humour are explored, illustrating the potential for the othering and exclusion of women through humour in technological spaces. We argue that this new iteration of heteronormative, hegemonic masculinity in online sexism, couched in “irony” and “joking”, serves to police, regulate and create rightful occupants and owners of such spaces. }

To this effect, Facebook released the Hateful Memes Challenge, a dataset of memes with pre-extracted text captions, but it is unclear whether these synthetic examples generalize to {`}memes in the wild{'}. In this paper, we collect hateful and non-hateful memes from Pinterest to evaluate out-of-sample performance on models pre-trained on the Facebook dataset. We find that {`}memes in the wild{'} differ in two key aspects: 1) Captions must be extracted via OCR, injecting noise and diminishing performance of multimodal models, and 2) Memes are more diverse than {`}traditional memes{'}, including screenshots of conversations or text on a plain background. This paper thus serves as a reality-check for the current benchmark of hateful meme detection and its applicability for detecting real world hate.",

However, such toxic information could also be communicated via multimodal content such as online memes. Therefore, detecting multimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and industry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging research topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that performed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically, DisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to improve the hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive experiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our experiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme classification task. Empirical case studies were also conducted to demonstrate DisMultiHate's ability to disentangle target entities in memes and ultimately showcase DisMultiHate's explainability of the multimodal hateful content classification task.},

In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach to fine-tune BERT-based models in different modalities. We also explore the effectiveness of ensembles of models trained in different modalities. We achieve an F1-score of 57.0, 48.2, and 52.1 in the corresponding subtasks.",

    abstract = "This paper describes our system participated in Task 6 of SemEval-2021: the task focuses on multimodal propaganda technique classification and it aims to classify given image and text into 22 classes. In this paper, we propose to use transformer based architecture to fuse the clues from both image and text. We explore two branches of techniques including fine-tuning the text pretrained transformer with extended visual features, and fine-tuning the multimodal pretrained transformers. For the visual features, we have tested both grid features based on ResNet and salient region features from pretrained object detector. Among the pretrained multimodal transformers, we choose ERNIE-ViL, a two-steam cross-attended transformers pretrained on large scale image-caption aligned data. Fine-tuing ERNIE-ViL for our task produce a better performance due to general joint multimodal representation for text and image learned by ERNIE-ViL. Besides, as the distribution of the classification labels is very unbalanced, we also make a further attempt on the loss function and the experiment result shows that focal loss would perform better than cross entropy loss. Last we have won first for subtask C in the final competition.",

A notable form of abuse in WhatsApp relies on several manipulated images and memes containing all kinds of fake stories. In this work, we performed an extensive data collection from a large set of WhatsApp publicly accessible groups and fact-checking agency websites. This paper opens a novel dataset to the research community containing fact-checked fake images shared through WhatsApp for two distinct scenarios known for the spread of fake news on the platform: the 2018 Brazilian elections and the 2019 Indian elections.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Reis, Julio C.
